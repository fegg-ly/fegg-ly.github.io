    <h1>Kaitlyn Musni's Assignment 5!</h1>
    <div class="header">

      <p>Assignment 5 took us beyond simple 5V ciruits and allowed us to 
        experiment with higher scale materials like power supplies and 
        LED light strips. We were also introduced to a transistor, which 
        is a device used to amplify or switch electronic signals. My 
        assignment uses a 12V power supply to power an LED light strip that 
        is turned on when I press the power button on an IR remote.

        The schematic on the left illustrates the two main components of the 
        circuit. Firstly, we have an LED light strip that is powered by a 12V 
        external power supply. It is then connected to the n-MOSFET transistor 
        that is attached to pin 9 on the Arduino which is then connected to GND. 
        The second component is the IR remote receiver, and has three pins. 
        The first pin is conneced to GND, the second is connected to 5V, and the 
        third is attached to the digital pin 7 on the Arduino.

        <p>
          Here is the calculation for the current flowing through the transistor. 
          We are first given with a few values. Each resistor on the LED strip 
          is labeled with 181, indicating a resistance of 180&Omega;. White LEDs have
          a voltage drop of ~3.5V, and there are 3 white LEDs in series for one section 
          of the strip (making each strip have a collective drop of 10.5V).

      <p>My circuit is relatively simple, since I only needed the n-MOSFET 
        transistor and the IR remote receiver. Since my code utilizes analogWrite(), 
        the transistor is connected to PWM pin 9 and the IR receiver is connected 
        to digital pin 7. What gets more difficult to manage in the photo was the 
        power supply, since the ground wire is connected directly into the board but 
        the power wire is wired to the LED strip via alligator clips.

        <b>Additional Questions</b><br>
        1. According to the data sheet, the maximum continuous drain 
        current is 37.2A when the temperature is above 25&deg;. Therefore,
        between pins 2 and 3, the absolute maximum current would be 37.2A
        and exceeding such value would damage the n-MOSFET<br>
