      <p>In this assignment, we were called to use a button to fade atleast 
        one LED light on a circuit. Shown on the left is a GIF of my circuit, 
        which features three LEDs and one button. When the button on the 
        breadboard is pressed, two LEDs turn on and one LED fades in 
        brightness level.

      <p>On the left is the schematic and calculations for the total
        current flowing through the circuit. The schematic shows three pins
        (one analog and 2 digital) connected in parallel and whose currents
        limited by 220&Omega;; resistors. Also shown is one push button whose
        current is limited by a 10k&Omega; resistor, which is large enough
        to provide a strong pull-down effect. This assures that the button
        is at 0V when unpressed and connects to 5V when pressed. The
        calculations below the schematic indicate that the total current
        running through the system is 0.0455A.

      <p>Here is a still photo of my circuit while the button is unpressed.
        In this state, none of the LEDs are lit, since the pull-down
        resistor assures that the button is at ground in this state. When
        pressed, the red LED fades, which is made possible by connecting 
        the LED to an analog pin (pin 11 ~) on the Arduino. The two green LEDs 
        simply turn on when the button is pressed. As the schematic suggests,
        we also see that all LEDs and the button are connected to ground,
        and are arranged in parallel.

        2. Assuming that the only thing that draws current are the LEDs,
        we can first calculate the total current of the system by 
        taking the sum of each LED's current. Each LED has a 1.8 voltage drop,
        so we calculate each individual current as (5-1.8)/220&Omega;= 0.015A. 
        Taking the sum of three individual currents, we get 0.045A. To 
        calculate how long the circuit will run with a 1200mAh battery (which
        would also be battery life), we can divide the battery capacity
        (1200mAh) by the total current (0.045A) to get 26,666 hours. <br>
